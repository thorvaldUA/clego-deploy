declare or <mark> directors’ decision to pay a dividend</mark> , or the terms on which shares are issued, specify otherwise, it must be paid by reference to each shareholder’s holding of shares on the date of the resolution or decision to declare or pay it.(5) If the company’s share capital is divided into different classes, no interim dividend may be paid on shares carrying deferred or non-preferred rights if, at the time of payment, any preferential dividend is in arrear.(6) <mark> The directors may pay at intervals any dividend payable at a fixed rate if it appears to them that the profits available for distribution justify the payment.</mark> (7) If the directors act in good faith, they do not incur any liability to the holders of shares conferring preferred rights for any loss they may suffer by the lawful payment of an interim dividend on shares with deferred or non-preferred rights. </p>

Shareholders’ reserve power 4.—(1) The shareholders may, by special resolution, direct the directors to take, or refrain from taking, specified action. (2) No such special resolution invalidates anything which the directors have done before the passing of the resolution. Directors may delegate 5.—(1) Subject to the articles, the directors may delegate any of the powers which are conferred on them under the articles— (a) to such person or committee; (b) by such means (including by power of attorney); (c) to such an extent; (d) in relation to such matters or territories; and (e) on such terms and conditions; as they think fit.

(3) The directors may revoke any delegation in whole or part, or alter its terms and conditions. Procedure for declaring dividends 30.—(1) The company may by ordinary resolution declare dividends, and  the directors may decide to pay interim dividends.  (2)  A dividend must not be declared unless the directors have made a recommendation as to its amount.  Such a dividend must not exceed the amount recommended by the directors. (3) No dividend may be declared or paid unless it is in accordance with shareholders’ respective rights. (4) Unless the shareholders’ resolution to declare or  directors’ decision to pay a dividend , or the terms on which shares are issued, specify otherwise, it must be paid by reference to each shareholder’s holding of shares on the date of the resolution or decision to declare or pay it. (5) If the company’s share capital is divided into different classes, no interim dividend may be paid on shares carrying deferred or non-preferred rights if, at the time of payment, any preferential dividend is in arrear. (6)  The directors may pay at intervals any dividend payable at a fixed rate if it appears to them that the profits available for distribution justify the payment.  (7) If the directors act in good faith, they do not incur any liability to the holders of shares conferring preferred rights for any loss they may suffer by the lawful payment of an interim dividend on shares with deferred or non-preferred rights. Powers to issue different classes of share 22.—(1) Subject to the articles, but without prejudice to the rights attached to any existing share, the company may issue shares with such rights or restrictions as may be determined by ordinary resolution.  (2) The company may issue shares which are to be redeemed, or are liable to be redeemed at the option of the company or the holder, and the directors may determine the terms, conditions and manner of redemption of any such shares. Share certificates 24.—(1) The company must issue each shareholder, free of charge, with one or more certificates in respect of the shares which that shareholder holds. 26.—(1) Shares may be transferred by means of an instrument of transfer in any usual form or any other form approved by the directors, which is executed by or on behalf of the transferor. (2) No fee may be charged for registering any instrument of transfer or other document relating to or affecting the title to any share. (3) The company may retain any instrument of transfer which is registered. (4) The transferor remains the holder of a share until the transferee’s name is entered in the register of members as holder of it. (5) The directors may refuse to register the transfer of a share, and if they do so, the instrument of transfer must be returned to the transferee with the notice of refusal unless they suspect that the proposed transfer may be fraudulent.

(2) No fee may be charged for registering any instrument of transfer or other document relating to or affecting the title to any share. (3) The company may retain any instrument of transfer which is registered. (4) The transferor remains the holder of a share until the transferee’s name is entered in the register of members as holder of it.

(3) No dividend may be declared or paid unless it is in accordance with shareholders’ respective rights. (4) Unless the shareholders’ resolution to declare or  directors’ decision to pay a dividend , or the terms on which shares are issued, specify otherwise, it must be paid by reference to each shareholder’s holding of shares on the date of the resolution or decision to declare or pay it. (5) If the company’s share capital is divided into different classes, no interim dividend may be paid on shares carrying deferred or non-preferred rights if, at the time of payment, any preferential dividend is in arrear. (6)  The directors may pay at intervals any dividend payable at a fixed rate if it appears to them that the profits available for distribution justify the payment.  (7) If the directors act in good faith, they do not incur any liability to the holders of shares conferring preferred rights for any loss they may suffer by the lawful payment of an interim dividend on shares with deferred or non-preferred rights.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </h5><p>Powers to issue different classes of share </h5><p> 22.—(1) Subject to the articles, but without prejudice to the rights attached to any existing share, the company may issue shares with such rights or restrictions as may be determined by ordinary resolution.
