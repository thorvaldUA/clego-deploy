Shareholders’ reserve power 4.—(1) The shareholders may, by special resolution, direct the directors to take, or refrain from taking, specified action. (2) No such special resolution invalidates anything which the directors have done before the passing of the resolution. Directors may delegate 5.—(1) Subject to the articles, the directors may delegate any of the powers which are conferred on them under the articles— (a) to such person or committee; (b) by such means (including by power of attorney); (c) to such an extent; (d) in relation to such matters or territories; and (e) on such terms and conditions; as they think fit. (2) If the directors so specify, any such delegation may authorise further delegation of the directors’ powers by any person to whom they are delegated. (3) The directors may revoke any delegation in whole or part, or alter its terms and conditions. Procedure for declaring dividends 30.—(1) The company may by ordinary resolution declare dividends, and  the directors may decide to pay interim dividends.

(3) No dividend may be declared or paid unless it is in accordance with shareholders’ respective rights. (4) Unless the shareholders’ resolution to declare or  directors’ decision to pay a dividend , or the terms on which shares are issued, specify otherwise, it must be paid by reference to each shareholder’s holding of shares on the date of the resolution or decision to declare or pay it. (5) If the company’s share capital is divided into different classes, no interim dividend may be paid on shares carrying deferred or non-preferred rights if, at the time of payment, any preferential dividend is in arrear. (6)  The directors may pay at intervals any dividend payable at a fixed rate if it appears to them that the profits available for distribution justify the payment.  (7) If the directors act in good faith, they do not incur any liability to the holders of shares conferring preferred rights for any loss they may suffer by the lawful payment of an interim dividend on shares with deferred or non-preferred rights.
